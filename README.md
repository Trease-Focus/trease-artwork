When submitting a new tree, you’ll be asked for:

- **Tree Name**: The name of your tree variant (e.g., "Cherry Blossom").
- **Description**: What makes your tree special or unique.
- **Author**: Your name or nickname.
- **Donation Link**: (Optional) A link where people can support you, or write "N/A".
- **Unlock Price**: The price to unlock this tree (e.g., 100 coins).
- **Growth Animation Video Link(s)**: Link(s) to video(s) showing your tree’s growth animation. You can add as many variants as you like—just paste each link on a new line.

## 4. Tree Drawing Guidelines

- **Canvas Size**: Your tree should always fit within a 480×480 pixel square.
- **No Grass Grid Needed**: You do **not** need to draw an isometric grass grid. Just draw the tree itself.
- **Simple is Best**: Focus on the tree. No need for extra backgrounds or decorations.

For inspiration and examples, check the [`lit_tree`](lit_tree/) folder in this repository.
